# 🛡️ Password Decryption Write-up
**Project:** LogicMaster-Archive  
**Technical Focus:** Security Logic & Pattern Recognition  
**Status:** Completed ✅

## 📑 Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance & Analysis
* Identified the password authentication mechanism.
* Analyzed the underlying logic for potential pattern weaknesses.
* Observed the system's response to various binary input sequences.

### 2. Logical Exploitation
* Applied **Binary Pattern Recognition** to predict the character sequence.
* Mapped out the logic gates used by the authentication script.
* Used a customized approach to bypass the validation layer without triggering security alerts.

### 3. Key Findings
* The system relied on predictable logical increments.
* **Result:** Successful decryption and access granted.
* **Security Recommendation:** Implement salted hashing and non-linear complexity to prevent pattern-based attacks.
